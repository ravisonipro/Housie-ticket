# Housie Ticket Generator
This is a simple Ruby program to generate a Housie ticket, also known as a bingo ticket. The generated ticket consists of 3 rows and 9 columns, with each column containing a random selection of numbers from 1 to 90, ensuring uniqueness within the ticket.

# How to Use
To generate a Housie ticket, simply run the `generate_housie_ticket` method provided in the code. This method creates and prints a Housie ticket to the console.

# To run a Ruby file in the terminal, follow these steps:
1. Open Terminal: Open your terminal or command prompt application.
2. Navigate to the Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your Ruby file is located. For example, if your Ruby file is located in a 
folder named my_project, you would navigate to it like this:

   $ cd path/to/my_project
   
3. Run the Ruby File: Once you're in the directory containing your Ruby file, you can run it by typing ruby followed by the name of your Ruby file. For example,  if your Ruby file is named housie_ticket_generator.rb, you would run it like this:

  $ ruby housie_ticket_generator.rb

4. View Output: If your Ruby script produces any output, such as printing information to the console, you'll see it displayed in the terminal after running the 
file.
